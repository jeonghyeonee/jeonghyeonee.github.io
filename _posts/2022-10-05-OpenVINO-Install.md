## OpenVINO
### What is "OpenVINO"?
OpenVINO is an Open Source Toolkit that optimize deep learning model to Intel Hardware product. It converts other Deep Learning framework(e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, and more) into OpenVINO model and deploy Inference.

VINO is an acronym of “**V**isual **I**nference **N**eural Network **O**ptimization”. You can see the means of VINO, OpenVINO focuses on optimizing Neural Network inference with a write-once, deploy-anywhere approach.



#### Extra
##### AI Inference
In the machine learning process, there are **2 phase**
1. Training phase  
It is developed by recording, storing, and labeling information/
2. Inference phase  
It is the machine uses the intelligence gathered and stored in phase onte to understand new data.
