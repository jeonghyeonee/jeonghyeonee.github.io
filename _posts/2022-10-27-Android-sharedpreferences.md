## SharedPreferences
### Intro
When I made an Android app, I thought how to store data to need for the app. I know Android Application data can store using SQlite. However I don't have to use database because the data size is very small. It means if I use SQlite it could cause adverse effect of application(it could be slow). In this reason, I look for another way to store the data.

### What is SharedPreferences

### Where is the Data stored

### SQlite vs. SharedPreferences
