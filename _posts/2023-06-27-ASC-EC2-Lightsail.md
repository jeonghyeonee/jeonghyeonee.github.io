## What is EC2?
EC2 stands for "Elastic Compute Cloud". It is the Cloud Computing Service of AWS. AWS serves the computer(virtual machine) to the users.

### The Advantage of EC2
- To be able to adjust the specifications freely
For example, you started the project with 1GB RAM, but needed more powerful machine after some time. In this situation, if you use EC2, you can change the computer's spec.(e.g. 5GB RAM)
